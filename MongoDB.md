### 1. What is MongoDB and how is it different from SQL databases?  

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON. Unlike SQL databases, which use structured tables and rows, MongoDB stores data in collections, which are similar to tables but don't enforce a rigid schema. This allows for more flexible and scalable data storage.

---

### 2. What are documents and collections in MongoDB?  

In MongoDB, a document is a single record stored in BSON format, similar to a row in a SQL database. A collection is a group of documents, similar to a table in SQL. Collections do not require documents to have the same structure, allowing for flexibility in data representation.

---

### 3. What are the key differences between MongoDB and Mongoose?  

MongoDB is the database itself, while Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library that provides a higher-level abstraction for working with MongoDB in Node.js. Mongoose simplifies interactions with MongoDB by adding features such as schema validation, middleware, and easier query building.

---

### 4. How do you insert data into MongoDB?  

To insert data into MongoDB, you can use the `insertOne()` or `insertMany()` methods. For example:

```js
const collection = db.collection('users');
collection.insertOne({ name: 'John', email

: 'john@example.com' });
```

---

### 5. What are CRUD operations in MongoDB?  

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the basic operations performed on documents in MongoDB:
- **Create**: Insert new documents.
- **Read**: Retrieve documents using queries.
- **Update**: Modify existing documents.
- **Delete**: Remove documents from the collection.

Continuing with the answers for MongoDB and Mongoose questions:

---

### 6. What is the use of the _id field in MongoDB documents?  

The `_id` field is a unique identifier automatically added to each document in MongoDB. It is used to identify documents in a collection, and its value is generated by MongoDB by default (usually a 12-byte ObjectId).

---

### 7. How do you query documents using filter operators like $gt, $in, $regex?  

MongoDB provides several operators to filter data:
- `$gt`: Greater than
- `$in`: Matches any value in an array
- `$regex`: Matches a string using regular expressions

Example:
```js
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 18 }, name: { $regex: /john/i } });
```

---

### 8. What is the aggregation pipeline in MongoDB?  

The aggregation pipeline is a framework that processes data in stages. Each stage transforms the data in some way (e.g., filtering, grouping, sorting) and passes it to the next stage. Common stages include `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, and `$project`.

```js
db.users.aggregate([
  { $match: { age: { $gte: 18 } } },
  { $group: { _id: "$city", total: { $sum: 1 } } }
]);
```

---

### 9. What are indexes in MongoDB? Why are they important?  

Indexes are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations. Without indexes, MongoDB must scan the entire collection to find documents. Indexes help make queries faster, especially when dealing with large datasets.

---

### 10. How does MongoDB ensure high availability and scalability?  

MongoDB ensures high availability and scalability through:
- **Replica Sets**: Copies of data are maintained across multiple servers, ensuring data availability if one server goes down.
- **Sharding**: Distributes data across multiple servers (shards) to scale horizontally by handling large datasets.

---

### 11. What is the difference between `find()` and `findOne()`?  

- `find()` returns an array of documents that match the query.
- `findOne()` returns the first document that matches the query or `null` if no document is found.

Example:
```js
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 18 } });  // Returns an array of users
db.users.findOne({ email: 'john@example.com' });  // Returns a single user
```

---

### 12. How do you update nested fields in a MongoDB document?  

To update nested fields, use dot notation to reference the field.

Example:
```js
db.users.updateOne(
  { _id: userId },
  { $set: { 'address.city': 'New York' } }
);
```

---

### 13. What is a capped collection?  

A capped collection is a fixed-size collection in MongoDB that automatically overwrites the oldest documents when the maximum size is reached. It ensures high performance for scenarios like logging.

Example:
```js
db.createCollection("logs", { capped: true, size: 100000 });
```

---

### 14. What is a replica set in MongoDB?  

A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain copies of the same data. One server is primary, and others are secondary. It provides data redundancy, high availability, and failover support.

---

### 15. What is sharding in MongoDB and when should you use it?  

Sharding is the process of distributing data across multiple servers (shards) to handle large datasets. It is used when a single server cannot handle the load or size of the data. MongoDB automatically manages data distribution across the shards.

---

### 16. How do you perform a text search in MongoDB?  

MongoDB supports text search with a special `text` index. You can search for text across multiple fields.

Example:
```js
db.articles.createIndex({ title: "text", content: "text" });
db.articles.find({ $text: { $search: "MongoDB" } });
```

---

### 17. What are transactions in MongoDB and when do you need them?  

Transactions in MongoDB allow multiple operations to be grouped together, ensuring atomicity. They are useful when you need to guarantee that a series of operations either all succeed or all fail (e.g., financial transactions).

---

### 18. What are some good practices for schema design in MongoDB?  

Good schema design practices include:
- Embed data when it makes sense (e.g., storing address details inside a user document).
- Use references when data is shared across multiple documents.
- Avoid deeply nested documents (keep them flat).
- Design for the queries youâ€™ll be running frequently.

---

### 19. What are the differences between embedded and referenced documents?  

- **Embedded documents**: Data is stored inside another document, which is faster to retrieve but may lead to duplication of data.
- **Referenced documents**: Data is stored in a separate document and linked by an `ObjectId`, reducing duplication but requiring additional queries for retrieval.

---

### 20. How do you handle security and access control in MongoDB?  

MongoDB supports authentication and authorization for security. 
- **Authentication**: Ensures that users are who they say they are (using usernames and passwords, LDAP, or X.509 certificates).
- **Authorization**: Defines what authenticated users can do (using roles and permissions).
